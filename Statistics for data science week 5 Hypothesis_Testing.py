# # **Hypothesis Testing**
# 

# Estimated time needed: **30** minutes
# 

# The goal of hypothesis testing is to answer the question, ‚ÄúGiven a sample and an apparent effect, what is the probability of seeing such an effect by chance?‚Äù The first step is to quantify the size of the apparent effect by choosing a test statistic (t-test, ANOVA, etc). The next step is to define a null hypothesis, which is a model of the system based on the assumption that the apparent effect is not real. Then compute the p-value, which is the probability of the null hypothesis being true, and finally interpret the result of the p-value, if the value is low, the effect is said to be statistically significant, which means that the null hypothesis may not be accurate.

df


# ## Lab Exercises
# 

# ### T-Test: Using the teachers' rating data set, does gender affect teaching evaluation rates?
# 

# We will be using the t-test for independent samples. For the independent t-test, the following assumptions must be met.
# * One independent, categorical variable with two levels or group
# * One dependent continuous variable
# * Independence of the observations. Each subject should belong to only one group. There is no relationship between the observations in each group.
# * The dependent variable must follow a normal distribution
# * Assumption of homogeneity of variance
# 

# State the hypothesis
# * $H_0: ¬µ_1 = ¬µ_2$ ("there is no difference in evaluation scores between male and females")
# * $H_1: ¬µ_1 ‚â† ¬µ_2$ ("there is a difference in evaluation scores between male and females")
# 

# We can plot the dependent variable with a historgram
# 

# In[6]:


ax = sns.distplot(df['eval'],
                  bins=20,
                  kde=True,
                  color='turquoise',
                  hist_kws={"linewidth": 15,'alpha':1})
ax.set(xlabel='Normal Distribution', ylabel='Frequency')
## we can assume it is normal


# We can use the Levene's Test in Python to check test significance
# 

# In[8]:


scipy.stats.levene(df[df['gender'] == 'female']['eval'],
                   df[df['gender'] == 'male']['eval'], center='mean')

# since the p-value is greater than 0.05 we can assume equality of variance


# Use the <code>ttest_ind</code> from the <code>scipy_stats</code> library
# 

# In[9]:


scipy.stats.ttest_ind(df[df['gender'] == 'female']['eval'],
                   df[df['gender'] == 'male']['eval'], equal_var = True)


# **Conclusion:** Since the p-value is less than alpha value 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis as there is enough proof that there is a statistical difference in teaching evaluations based on gender
# 

# ### ANOVA: Using the teachers' rating data set, does beauty  score for instructors  differ by age?
# 

# First, we group the data into cateries as the one-way ANOVA can't work with continuous variable - using the example from the video, we will create a new column for this newly assigned group our categories will be teachers that are:
# * 40 years and younger
# * between 40 and 57 years
# * 57 years and older
# 

# In[10]:


df.loc[(df['age'] <= 40), 'age_group'] = '40 years and younger'
df.loc[(df['age'] > 40)&(df['age'] < 57), 'age_group'] = 'between 40 and 57 years'
df.loc[(df['age'] >= 57), 'age_group'] = '57 years and older'


# State the hypothesis
# * $H_0: ¬µ_1 = ¬µ_2 = ¬µ_3$ (the three population means are equal)
# * $H_1:$ At least one of the means differ
# 

# Test for equality of variance
# 

# In[11]:


scipy.stats.levene(df[df['age_group'] == '40 years and younger']['beauty'],
                   df[df['age_group'] == 'between 40 and 57 years']['beauty'], 
                   df[df['age_group'] == '57 years and older']['beauty'], 
                   center='mean')
# since the p-value is less than 0.05, the variance are not equal, for the purposes of this exercise, we will move along


# First, separate the three samples (one for each job category) into a variable each.
# 

# In[12]:


forty_lower = df[df['age_group'] == '40 years and younger']['beauty']
forty_fiftyseven = df[df['age_group'] == 'between 40 and 57 years']['beauty']
fiftyseven_older = df[df['age_group'] == '57 years and older']['beauty']


# Now, run a one-way ANOVA.
# 

# In[13]:


f_statistic, p_value = scipy.stats.f_oneway(forty_lower, forty_fiftyseven, fiftyseven_older)
print("F_Statistic: {0}, P-Value: {1}".format(f_statistic,p_value))


# **Conclusion:** Since the p-value is less than 0.05, we will reject the null hypothesis as there is significant evidence that at least one of the means differ.
# 

# ### ANOVA: Using the teachers' rating data set, does teaching  evaluation  score for instructors  differ  by age?
# 

# Test for equality of variance
# 

# In[14]:


scipy.stats.levene(df[df['age_group'] == '40 years and younger']['eval'],
                   df[df['age_group'] == 'between 40 and 57 years']['eval'], 
                   df[df['age_group'] == '57 years and older']['eval'], 
                   center='mean')


# In[15]:


forty_lower_eval = df[df['age_group'] == '40 years and younger']['eval']
forty_fiftyseven_eval = df[df['age_group'] == 'between 40 and 57 years']['eval']
fiftyseven_older_eval = df[df['age_group'] == '57 years and older']['eval']


# In[16]:


f_statistic, p_value = scipy.stats.f_oneway(forty_lower_eval, forty_fiftyseven_eval, fiftyseven_older_eval)
print("F_Statistic: {0}, P-Value: {1}".format(f_statistic,p_value))


# **Conclusion:** Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, we will fail to reject the null hypothesis as there is no significant evidence that at least one of the means differ.
# 

# ### Chi-square: Using the teachers' rating data set, is there an association between tenure and gender?
# 

# State the hypothesis:
# * $H_0:$ The proportion of teachers who are tenured is independent of gender
# * $H_1:$ The proportion of teachers who are tenured is associated with gender
# 

# Create a Cross-tab table
# 

# In[17]:


cont_table  = pd.crosstab(df['tenure'], df['gender'])
cont_table


# Use the <code>scipy.stats</code> library and set correction equals False as that will be the same answer when done by hand, it returns: ùúí2 value, p-value, degree of freedom, and expected values.
# 

# In[18]:


scipy.stats.chi2_contingency(cont_table, correction = True)


# **Conclusion:** Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. As there is no sufficient evidence that teachers are tenured as a result of gender.
# 

# ### Correlation: Using the teachers rating dataset, Is teaching  evaluation  score correlated with  beauty score?
# 

# State the hypothesis:
# * $H_0:$ Teaching evaluation score is not correlated with beauty score
# * $H_1:$ Teaching evaluation score is correlated with beauty score
# 

# Since they are both continuous variables we can use a pearson correlation test and draw a scatter plot
# 

# In[19]:


ax = sns.scatterplot(x="beauty", y="eval", data=df)


# In[20]:


scipy.stats.pearsonr(df['beauty'], df['eval'])


# **Conclusion:** Since the p-value  (Sig. (2-tailed)  < 0.05, we reject  the Null hypothesis and conclude that there  exists a relationship between  beauty and teaching evaluation score.
# 

# ## Practice Questions
# 

# ### Question 1: Using the teachers rating data set, does tenure affect teaching evaluation scores?
# * Use Œ± = 0.05

# At the Œ± = 0.01, p-value is greater, we fail to reject null hypothesis as there is no evidence of an association between age and tenure
# At the Œ± = 0.05, p-value is less, we reject null hypoothesis as there is evidence of an association between age and tenure

# Double-click **here** for a hint.
# 
# <!-- The hint is below:
# ## state your hypothesis
# Null Hypothesis: There is no association between age and tenure
# Alternative Hypothesis: There is an association between age and tenure
# 
# ## don't forget to create a cross tab of the data
# cont_table  = pd.crosstab(ratings_df['tenure'], ratings_df['age_group'])

# 

# Double-click **here** for the solution.
# 
# <!-- The answer is below:
# ## use the chi-square function
# scipy.stats.chi2_contingency(cont_table, correction = True)
# At the Œ± = 0.01, p-value is greater, we fail to reject null hypothesis as there is no evidence of an association between age and tenure
# At the Œ± = 0.05, p-value is less, we reject null hypoothesis as there is evidence of an association between age and tenure
# -->
# 

# ### Question 3: Test for equality of variance for beauty scores between tenured and non-tenured instructors
# * Use Œ± = 0.05
# 

# In[26]:

                   df[df['tenure'] == 'no']['beauty'],                     
                   center='mean')


# Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, we will assume equality of variance of both groups

# Double-click **here** for the solution.
# 
# <!-- The answer is below:
# ### use the levene function to find the p-value and conclusion
# scipy.stats.levene(ratings_df[ratings_df['tenure'] == 'yes']['beauty'],
#                    ratings_df[ratings_df['tenure'] == 'no']['beauty'], 
#                    center='mean')
# Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, we will assume equality of variance of both groups
# -->
